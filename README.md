# Token Sale Contracts

A collection of contracts used for typical token sales.
They are based on Consensys' standard implementation of ERC20.

## Overview

The token sales contract implements the HumanStandardToken and inherits the following properties:

## Token Distribution

  * 20% will be distributed to owner's wallet
  * 10% will be sold during the pre-sale (capped @ configurable value)
  * 50% will be sold during the official sale (capped @ configurable value)
  * 20% will held in a time-locked wallet, distributed to the owner after a configurable vesting period

## Handling contractors during pre-sale period

It is recommended that contractors are paid by transferring tokens from the owner's wallet to the contractor.
